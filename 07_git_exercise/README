4.using echo "2">abc.txt
5.the color is different red file modified
6.git diff
7.using git diff --staged It doesnt show any changes because the file abc.txt is in working tree
8.diff stage2 return fatal error because stage 2 in unknown path and it is not in the working tree and we sould use the separator -- before.
9.git add abc.txt  using git status = green
10.git diff print nothing because all of the changes as been commented!
11.git diff --staged
12. using echo 3 >> abc.txt
13.not the same output because the git diff shows the different between the working area to the staging area.
14.the file appear twice because one time (add 2) we commented the file color green.and the second time we change the file (add 3) the color is red
   and it let you know that you need to commit one file.
15.git reset --hard
