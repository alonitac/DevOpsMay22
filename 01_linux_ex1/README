Kernel System Calls
-------------------

when we ran the whatIdo executable a few things happened in the background before the program ran this call the most common things that happened are:
 - a child process is created to load the new program.
 - the process gets a memory address from the kernel.
 - the kernel checks permissions on the file.
 - the kernel map the memory location with the size of the file he got from the fstat() function and the preparation end with the close() function.
 after the preparation, the kernel opens the file with the openat() function and creates welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck and then
 the kernel uses the write() function to write "There you go... tell me what I d"... all of this process ends with close() and exit_group().

Binary Numbers
--------------

 1. conversion between binary to decimal numbers
 a.111 = 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
 b.100 = 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
 c.10110 = 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+0+4+2+0 = 22

2. decimal range in 8 bit
full 8 bit use - 11111111 =
1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 1*2^2 1*2^1 1*2^0 = 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255

3. negative number in 9 bits
in order to represent a negative number we need to use the ninth bit that in charge on the positive(0) and negative(1) value
9 bit use - 111111111 =
negative 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 1*2^2 1*2^1 1*2^0 = 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = -255

4. representing a floating point number
