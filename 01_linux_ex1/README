Kernel System Calls
-------------------
## A. Create dir and permissions
1. mkdir welcometodevopsmay22
2. give permissions to user (0) r+W+X (0700)
mkdir("./welcomeToDevOpsMay22", 0700)   = 0


## B. Create file "goodluck" in new dir and permissions
openat(AT_FDCWD, "welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

## C. Write A Text line inside "goodluck" file
write(3, "There you go... tell me what I do"..., 36) = 36


Broken Symlink
-------------------
## Symptom:
In creating a symbolic link, the link and the $ variable file must be located at the same folder level
In case one of the contents is moved to another location, deleted, or renamed the link is will break


## Recognition:
A valid symbolic link will appear in green, in case it is broken it will appear in red

## Fix:
In addition to repositioning the files in the same folder level, it is possible to turn the symbolic link into a hard link by typing the command:
# ln -sfn /a/full/path/$FILEPATH backup.obj
or
# ln $FILENAME backup.obj



Binary Numbers
--------------
## 1. Binary to Decimals conversion
a. 111   = 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 4+2+1 = 7
b. 100   = 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 4+0+0 = 4
c. 10110 = 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+0+4+2+0 = 22

## 2. What is the available...
11111111 = 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255

## 3. 9 bits negative binary number...
9 bits = 111111111 -255
111001010 = (1) 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^1 = -202

 ## 4. Floating point to binary
 5.5 = 101.1

1. 5 = 101
5 / 2 = 2 with remainder 1
2 / 2 = 1 with remainder 0
1 / 2 = 0 with remainder 1

0.5 ^ 2 = 1 + 0
